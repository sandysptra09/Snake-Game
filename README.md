# 🐍 Snake Game Simulation (C++ Console Game)

A simple mini project that simulates a text-based Snake game on a terminal/console using the C++ programming language. This project utilizes **Circular Linked List** to dynamically model the snake's body, as well as the use of **pointer** and **struct** as part of the data structure learning material.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Snake movement (up, down, left, right) using keyboard input
- ✅ Eat food to increase length
- ✅ Game Over if the snake hits itself
- ✅ Simple text-based grid view
- ✅ Scores & Levels that increase with the length of the snake
- ✅ Bonus: Snake speed increases with level up

---

## 🧱 Data Structure Used

- `struct Node`: represents one part of the snake's body
- `Circular Linked List`: each node points to the next body part, and the last node points back to the head
- Pointer for node manipulation as the snake moves and grows in length
